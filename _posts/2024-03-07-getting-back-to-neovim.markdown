For some reason I bumped into streamer called [Primeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen). He uses Vim as his editor and I've used Vim in the past quite a lot. When I came back to software industry, I didn't get back to using Vim for some reason. I've used quite a lot of time honing my Vim skills and plugin setup, but clearly Prime (let's call [Primeagen/Michael](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/ThePrimeagen) Prime for now) is magnitudes faster than I've been. He uses tmux as well and dvorak. Dvorak has been my dream for years, but I haven't given the time to learn that.

So I dug deeper into question 'Who is this Prime guy?'. I found out that he has been very open with his setup and he also has couple of courses about the topic: [Developer productivity](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/developer-productivity) and [Vim fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vim-fundamentals).

I also liked his streams based on a quick glance. The one I watched for a while was a stream about [Turso](https://turso.tech/). Turso is some sort of SQLite-cloud and I need to dig deeper into Turso, but that is for later.

It took quite a while clean my old Vim plugins, because there was many broken ones and ones that I don't use. The current setup is:

* ack.vim
* bufexlorer
* ctrlp.vim
* nerdcommenter
* nerdtree
* tabular
* tagbar
* vim-fugitive
* vim-gist
* vim-markdown
* vim-substitute

I still need to deepen my understanding of these plugins and re-remember the hotkeys etc.
